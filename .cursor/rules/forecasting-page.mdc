Feature Specification: Forecasting Page

Overview:This document defines the layout and functionality of the Forecasting Page in the Achievr app. The goal is to provide users with clear, interactive insights into their projected financial trajectory over various time spans, with scenario simulation capabilities.

▶ Top Section: Summary Widgets

Display 4 key metrics at the top of the page. These should respond to a user-selected forecast range (options: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months):

Current Available

Current balance minus any savings committed to active goals.

Projected Income

Total of all recurring incomes and other expected income events scheduled within the selected range.

Projected Expenses

Total of all recurring bills/expenses and other known expense events within the selected range.

Projected Available

Calculated as: Current Balance + Projected Income - Projected Expenses.

▶ Middle Section: Cash Flow Over Time Graph

A full-width dynamic graph showing cash flow movement over time within the selected forecast window:

X-Axis: Date range (based on filter)

Y-Axis: Projected account balance

Line Graph shows running balance starting from current available balance

Each point on the graph represents one or more income or expense events

Hover Tooltip for Graph Dots:

Date of event

Starting balance that day

All income entries with descriptions and values

All expense/bill entries with descriptions and values

▶ Bottom Section

Left Widget: Monthly Breakdown

Display monthly net cash flow for each of the next 12 months

Net = Total income - Total expenses for each month

Display visually as a bar or mini line chart with net positive/negative indicators

Right Widget: Scenario Simulation Tool

Allow users to simulate future financial changes. Options include:

Increase income by a fixed %

Apply a raise to specific recurring income line items

Adjust recurring bills/expenses by a %

Add a monthly savings increase (fixed $)

Add a one-time unexpected expense (fixed $)

Add a one-time unexpected income/gift (fixed $)

Behavior:

After scenario is applied, all widgets (including the top 4 and main graph) show both:

Original projection

Scenario-adjusted projection

Clearly distinguish projections (e.g., color-coded lines or dual value display)

Scenario mode is additive: it overlays on top of the existing forecast data

Design Notes:

This page contains no other widgets

Layout must be clean, responsive, and performant with variable event data
